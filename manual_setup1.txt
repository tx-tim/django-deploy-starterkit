Setup Virtual Box



setup Vagrant





Instantiate a ubuntu server 32bit as a virtual guest machine

Download a 32bit virtual machine. You only need to do this once
    
    $ vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box
    
    Notes:
        the files that you download will be automatically saved in ~/.vagrant.d/boxes/
        You only need to download a base image once. after that you can instantiate clones of this base image multiple times. 


Create your virtual machine from the base image

    $ cd vagrant
    $ vagrant up
    

    Notes:
        'Vagrant up' will read the Vagrantfile and instantiate a new vm for you. you will see this output:

        [web_server_1] The guest additions on this VM do not match the install version of
        VirtualBox! This may cause things such as forwarded ports, shared
        folders, and more to not work properly. If any of those things fail on
        this machine, please update the guest additions and repackage the
        box.
